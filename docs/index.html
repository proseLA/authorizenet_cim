        <H2>How to Install</H2>

        <li>There are 2 directories that mirror your zen-cart install; an includes directory and an admin directory
        </li>
        <li>Rename the YOUR_TEMPLATE directory within the includes/templates directory to the name of the template that
            you using.
        </li>
        <li>Now copy the includes directory into the includes directory of your store. This is a merge.</li>
        <li>Rename the admin directory to the name of your admin directory and merge it with your existing admin
            directory.
        </li>
        <li>If you need help with FTPing the files up to your server, or an FTP client, go to the zen-cart forum.</li>
        <li>Go to Admin -> Modules -> Payment and you will see 2 new payment modules</li>
        <li><b>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE,</b> even if you already have an authorize.net account:<br><br> <h2><a href="http://reseller.authorize.net/application/?resellerId=111066">Create a new one using the link here</a></h2>  <li>In this way, you can keep the transactions made using this NEW module separate from your old way of taking transactions.  In addition, creating an account here benefits me, allowing me to do additional development.</li>
        <li>For those of you who already have an authorize.net account and have no desire to create a new one, there is a <a href="#money"> contribution link to mxWorks at the bottom of this page.</a></li>
        <li>Enable authorizenet_cim, enter your API login ID and transaction key. Select Test mode or Production Mode.
            And you are off and running.
        </li>
        <li>Card on File transactions are automatically enabled when authorizenet_cim gets enabled.  CVV is automatically turned on for COF.  See notes below on v2.01 for more information.</li>
        <li>I like using liveMode for validation even when in the test environment. That way you are validating test
            credit cards.
        </li>
        <li>Debugging is done via the selection of Debug Mode or by creating a new constant called DEBUG_CIM and setting
            it to boolean true.
        </li>
        <li>If you are updating from a previous version, you can just copy these files and replace the old files.</li>

        <H2>Notes</H2>

        <li>There are NO core zen-cart files modified.
        </li>
        <li>There are no additional fields added to any zen-cart tables</li>
        <li>There are 5 new tables that are part of this module.</li>
        <li>Transactions are now authorize or authorize/capture.  Authorize only transactions add a capture button on the admin side.</li>
        <li>There is a very visible button on the admin for refunding all or part of an order.</li>
        <li>If you try refunding prior to settling, the module displays the void window.  At that point, only a void is available.</li>
        <li>Read what is on the pop-up window when doing refunds/voids.  It explains a lot.</li>
        <li>This module will log all FAILED transactions to cim_response.log in the logs directory. To see all
            transactions (including successful transactions) in that log file, one can set the key
            MODULE_PAYMENT_AUTHORIZENET_CIM_DEBUGGING to true; OR create a new constant called DEBUG_CIM and set that to
            true. both of these do the same thing.
        </li>
        <li>Once debug is on, this module will create ZC style debug logs with all response data.</li>
        <li>There is NO option to store responses in a table or to be emailed responses.  The log files are it.</li>
        <li>PCI-DSS is legal document. I am not a lawyer. I offer no opinion on this module as to how it effects your
            PCI-DSS status.
        </li>
        <li>I have done everything that i think necessary to protect cardholder data. If you think this module violates
            any tenet of PCI-DSS, feel free to open an issue with <a href="https://github.com/proseLA/authorizenet_cim/" target="_blank">me on github.</a>  The code is there for anyone to see.  I take protection of cardholder data SERIOUSLY.
        </li>
        <li>CIM looks to be now included with all authorize.net accounts.</li>
        <li>This module has been tested for zen-cart v1.5.6 and v1.5.7.</li>
        <li>If you are using v1.5.6a, make sure you add the following 2 lines of code to the file YOUR_ADMIN/includes/footer.php (I included the closing footer line for reference):</li>
<pre>
    &lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;?php
    $zco_notifier->notify('NOTIFY_ADMIN_FOOTER_END');
    </pre>
        <li>Refunds must be issued within 120 days of the transaction. This is inherent in the system from authorize.net.
        </li>
        <li>I have tested this module for compatibility with OPC (One Page Checkout).  It works.</li>
        <li>There is no warranty, express and/or implied, that this module will work or is well suited for your
            particular application.
        </li>
        <li>Support for this module is on the zen-cart forum.
        </li>
        <li>Admins can delete all cards on file for any customer.  There is a button for it on the customer page.</li>
        <li>There is an option for customers to add, update, and delete credit cards from within their account.  Styling has been done to match responsive_classic and one would need to add a link to ->  index.php?main_page=card_update.  I am not the styling expert.</li>
        <br>
        <h2>Notes on Version 3.0.0</h2>
        <li>This version is ONLY for zenCart versions v158 and higher!</li>
        <li>Requires a minimum of php 8.0.</li>
        <li>If you are upgrading when a previous version, please ensure you delete your old language files.  There were 2 on the storefront side; and 1 on the admin side.</li>
        <li>All new language files are now on the storefront side, and are in the format of lang.*.php</li>
        <li>The rest of the install instructions stay the same.</li>
        <br>

        <br>
        <h2>Notes on Version 2.2.2</h2>
        <li>Order Status for this module is only updated on <b>capture of funds.</b>  If you are set for Authorize and Capture, then configured completed order status will happen then.  Else status will change to configured completed order status when funds are captured.</li>
        <br>
        <h2>Notes on Version 2.2.1</h2>

        <li>Bug fixes on admin side pop-up window.</li>
        <br>
        <H2>Notes on Version 2.0.1</H2>
        <li>I have done some cleanup on the admin side</li>
        <li>The refund window is now separate from a void window.  Voids can only be done on unsettled transactions.  As currently, this module is ONLY authorize/capture; there is no opportunity to capture for less than the original amount.</li>
        <li>I have made modifications to the CVV code as described in <a href="https://github.com/proseLA/authorizenet_cim/issues/21">this issue.</a>  The CVV code needs to be in sync with the settings on your authorize dashboard.  My opinion is to require the CVV for the new card; but not for the card on file.  But you can set it up for one or both or neither.  You just need to ensure that you have it in sync with your dashboard.</li>
        <li>Addressed <a href="https://github.com/proseLA/authorizenet_cim/issues/20">order total not having the correct decimal places.</a>  I thought this issue worthy of warranting a minor update.</li>
